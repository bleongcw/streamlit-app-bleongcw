# Welcome to my personal training

I am using this repository for personal training to go thru streamlit, writing my python scripts and understanding how things work. 
it's based on a Udemy course which I am working on and things which I am interested in. 

This is the app you get when you run `streamlit hello`, extracted as its own app.

Edit [Hello.py](./Hello.py) to customize this app to your heart's desire. ❤️

Check it out on [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://st-hello-app.streamlit.app/)
